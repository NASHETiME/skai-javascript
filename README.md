A <b>VERY</b> Basic Javascript Chess Engine

*******************************************

A basic chess engine written in javacript, plays at about
~700 elo at a depth of 4. Has Alpha-Beta algorithm implemented
and that is all it has. Very basic.

Feel free to reuse the code and do as you please. It is simply
a template on top of which a much more powerful engine can be built.
